# FinEdge Website

This website was developed using Vite + React JS and styled with Tailwind CSS. The design follows a clean and minimalistic approach, with a focus on readability and scalability. The use of Tailwind CSS greatly facilitated the styling process by providing utility classes and allowing for easy customization.

## Design and Development Process

- The website was designed to have a clean and professional look, with a minimalist color palette that avoids overpowering colors.
- Each section of the website was designed to be scalable, allowing for easy updates and modifications by centralizing information in the constants section.
- The use of components in the code structure ensured better code organization and improved understanding of the codebase.
- The code was written with a focus on readability and maintainability, making it easier for other developers to understand and collaborate on the project.

## Challenges and Resolutions

- One major challenge was assigning all the information to constants and passing it into each component. To overcome this, I created a constants file where all the necessary information was stored, and then passed the required data to each component. This approach improved code reusability and made it easier to update information across the entire website.
